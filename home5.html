	<!--about-->
	<div id="content">
	
		<h1 id="otherheaders">About Me</h1>
		<p> Clients often approach me when they need a developer who can provide:
			Responsive Websites
			Front-end Development
			HTML
			CSS
			JavaScript
			jQuery
			AngularJS </p>

		<p>The work I provide is of highest quality, fully responsive, and tested in a wide range of devices.
			 I take great care to ensure each project is well-documented and easily maintainable so you can enhance a website as your company grows.
			Often front-end development of a website is overlooked, but being the part of your project that combines design,
			 back-end development and the layer that your users interact with, from my experience, it is the most important to get right.
			My clients have found that launching with a well considered and well developed front-end has saved them 
			time and money and makes for a product that is consistently of high quality.
			</p>
		<p>
			In my past experience as a freelancer and working for agencies I have also obtained an eye for
			 detail and appreciation for design, knowledge of integrating with and developing server-side, 
			 as well as knowing how to efficiently project manage and work with clients and colleagues successfully.
			I now specialise in WordPress and front-end development but my knowledge of multiple fields allows me
			 to work on a project with the full scope in mind; simplifying the process of our working together 
			 and producing a more cohesive experience for your users.</p>
